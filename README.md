# AUTO-INSURANCE-CLAIMS-FRAUD-DETECTION

The insurance industry faces significant challenges in detecting fraudulent claims, which can lead to 
substantial financial losses. By accurately identifying potentially fraudulent claims, insurance companies 
can optimize their resource allocation, reduce financial losses, and maintain fair pricing for legitimate 
policyholders. The project leverages the power of Apache Spark and its machine learning library (MLlib) 
to handle large datasets and build scalable predictive models. This project aims to develop a machine 
learning model to predict the likelihood of fraud in insurance claims using various features such as policy 
details, accident circumstances, and demographic information.
